      <div class="survey">
        <h2 class="article-title survey-title">Survey</h2>
        <p class="text">With a clear objective for Free Bird established, it was time to address a number of questions. What is the best way for people to connect with local communities? Is it possible to immerse yourself within a short time? What types of experiences are people looking for? What is the most intuitive way to facilitate these experiences? It was necessary to research users’ current travel behaviors and try to pinpoint opportunities for improvement and what needs remained unmet. It was also important to determine what activities truly enrich a travel experience.</p>
        <h4 class="excerpt text-right survey-excerpt">What is the best way for people to connect with local communities?</h4>
        <p class="text">After conducting a detailed user survey a number of responses offered key insights into advantages Free Bird could potentially provide:</p>
        <div class="stats">
          <div class="stat">
            <p class="percentage">94%</p>
            <p class="stat-description">Would consider volunteering on future trips</p>
          </div>
          <div class="stat">
            <p class="percentage">67%</p>
            <p class="stat-description">Don’t always know the best way to engage with local communities</p>

          <div class="stat">

          </div>
        </div>
      </div>
      <p class="text">Overall, the user is looking for a unique opportunity, however, they cannot fully explore the potential of their travel destinations. The survey exhibited that there is an opportunity for Free Bird to offer users a new service and an enriched travel experience they currently have not been exposed to.</p>
      <!-- The User -->
      <div class="user">
        <h2 class="article-title user-title">The User</h2>
        <p class="text">It was pertinent to make Free Bird a valuable resource for different types of travelers. From the survey, two main user personas emerged. For the eager explorer, a seasoned globetrotter, Free Bird enables them to expand their already diverse connections. They will also enjoy the convenience and added accessibility. For the curious discoverer who wants to connect but perhaps isn’t sure of the best way how, Free Bird will open new possibilities and directions. With durations ranging from 1 day to 1 month, this app is both for people taking a short trip and for those traveling for an extended time.</p>

      <div class="container container-one">
        <h2 class="article-title mvp-title">Creating the MVP</h2>
        <p class="text">The next step was to create user stories and flows in Google Drive so I could identify the main objectives and develop an MVP. I wanted users to be able to communicate and book experiences directly with organizations, therefore there would need to be a separate flow. I knew that I would develop the interactive prototype for users booking experiences but I felt to truly have an understanding of how the app would function I wanted to conceptualize both ends of the process.  Therefore, I developed user stories for new and returning organizations to make sure the app would enable their main objectives as well.</p>
        <img class="mvp-assets user-stories" src="assets/free_bird/user_stories.png">

      <div class="container container-two">

          <p class="sub-heading">KEEPING IT LIGHT</p>
          <p class="right-div-text">After hand-sketching some basic layouts, low fidelity wireframes were developed in Sketch. At this point Free Bird was moving from the conceptual phase to existing on a visual plane. I started making many small decisions to allow users to accomplish all of their objectives intuitively and effortlessly. I wanted the Free Bird user to feel excited about the experiences they are about to embark on, I didn’t want them to have to shift their focus or encounter any subtle annoyances.</p>
        </div>

      <div class="container container-three">
        <p class="sub-heading">FOCUSING ON FUNDAMENTALS</p>
        <p class="text">Once I began drawing out the wireframes, I was able to have a better idea of how these options would affect the overall user experience. For instance, I was debating whether or not to include social logins. They are included in some user flows, however, I decided to not include them in the initial version of Free Bird. I wanted the first version to focus on the most vital functions and to keep users focused specifically on the Free Bird initiative. Therefore I felt it would be stronger not to introduce other brands or logos in an overt manner.</p>

          <p class="sub-heading">OPTIMIZING FACILITY</p>
          <p class="right-div-text">While browsing, the user has the option to save an experience. I initially thought I would include these “saved experiences” within “experiences” in the bottom nav. I later decided that because I wanted users to be able to save experiences quickly and easily to refer back to, I wanted the “Saved” icon to be obvious and convenient. Therefore, I included it as its own icon in the nav because I felt that it was a significant function and if users needed to click around to find it, it defeated the purpose of having it in the first place.</p>

      <div class="identity">
        <h2 class="article-title identity-title">Identity</h2>
        <p class="text">When designing the logo, I initially looked to the simple, silhouetted forms of hieroglyphics for inspiration. I liked the concept of a pictorial language, figures representing specific meanings. It was also important for the logo to have a unifying, international reference, yet remain indefinite to not focus on any one area. Although not literal representations of the glyphs, the logo is a combination of three symbols which convey the multi-dimensional message of Free Bird.</p>
